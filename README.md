# Agar.io Clone

A recreation of [agar.io](http://agar.io/) by Sami Abood and Alex Matson.


Currently a work in progress, this project utilizes PHP to run the server and the
Ratchet library to enable real-time multiplayer through WebSocket.


Javascript and HTML is used for the front-end.

### Testing

If you'd like to test what we have so far, you need to install PHP and [Ratchet](http://socketo.me/docs/install).

After that is all set up, simply execute `php bin\serverScript.php` in the root directory,
and open index.html in two different browsers.
